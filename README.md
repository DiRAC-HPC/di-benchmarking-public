# DiRAC Benchmarks (Data Intensive)

This repository contains the software, inputs, results, analysis for the DiRAC Data Intensive benchmarks. More 
information about the individual benchmarks can be found in the appropriate subdirectories:

   - AREPO - AREPO is a massively parallel gravity and magnetohydrodynamics code for astrophysics, designed for problems of large dynamic range **Note: the AREPO benchmark is not yet available.**
   - [RAMSES](RAMSES/) - Adaptive Mesh Refinement for self-gravitating magnetized fluid flows
   - [TROVE](TROVE/) - TROVE is a variational program and method for accurate and efficient calculations of rovibrational energies and spectra of general polyatomic molecules.
   - [sphNG](sphNG/) - sphNG is a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code
